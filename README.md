# geany-hcl-syntax-highlighting
Custom configuration file for the Geany text editor that allows highlighting of Terraform's HCL (Hashicorp configuration files) files. Only supports highlighting of AWS resources.

This is very rough draft, copy-and-pasted from examples and tweaked until it worked.

## Installation on Linux

- Copy filetypes.HCL.conf to ~/.config/geany/filedefs
- Edit your ~/.config/geany/filetype_extensions.conf and add the following under [Extensions]:

```
HCL=*.tf;*.tfvars;
```

- Optional: copy main.tf to ~/.config/geany/templates/files/main.tf

   This will make template file accessible from  File -> New (with Template) -> main.tf
- Restart Geany
